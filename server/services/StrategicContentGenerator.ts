BUSINESS CONTEXT:
- Business: TheAgencyIQ (Queensland SME automation platform)
- Target Audience: Time-poor Queensland business owners needing visibility
- Core Purpose: Help busy owners with automated social media for professional visibility
- Brand Promise: "Stop being invisible - get your always-on beacon"

PLATFORMS AVAILABLE: ${params.platforms.join(', ')}
TOTAL POSTS NEEDED: ${params.totalPosts}
START DATE: 2025-07-19 (30-day calendar)

KEY QUEENSLAND EVENTS TO ALIGN WITH:
- Curated Plate: July 25 - August 3 (premium dining/networking)
- Great Barrier Reef Festival: August 1-3 (tourism/local pride)
- Taste Port Douglas: August 7-10 (local business showcase)
- Brisbane Ekka: July-August (major Queensland event)
- School holidays impact (business networking timing)

TASK: Create strategic 30-day calendar from 2025-07-19 onwards. CRITICAL: Distribute all ${params.totalPosts} posts across the FULL 30-day period (2025-07-19 to 2025-08-17). Do NOT cluster posts on same dates.

DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS:
- Spread ${params.totalPosts} posts across 30 days (approximately ${Math.round(params.totalPosts/30)} posts per day)
- Use different dates for each post to maximize timeline coverage
- Align with Queensland events when relevant dates match

1. **Event Alignment Strategy**:
   - Pre-event buzz building (1-2 days before)
   - During-event engagement (real-time relevance)
   - Post-event follow-up (networking continuation)

2. **Platform-Day Optimization**:
   - LinkedIn: Tuesday-Thursday B2B peaks
   - Facebook: Wednesday-Friday community engagement
   - Instagram: Thursday-Sunday visual content performance
   - X: Monday-Wednesday conversation windows  
   - YouTube: Weekend educational consumption

3. **Busy Owner Psychology**:
   - Monday motivation (new week energy)
   - Wednesday wisdom (mid-week expertise)
   - Friday inspiration (week-end positivity)
