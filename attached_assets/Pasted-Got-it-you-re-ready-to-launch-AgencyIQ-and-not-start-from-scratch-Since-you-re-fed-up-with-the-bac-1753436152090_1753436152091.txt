Got it, you’re ready to launch AgencyIQ and not start from scratch. Since you’re fed up with the back-and-forth, let’s cut through the noise and focus on getting your social media automation app launch-ready. You’ve mentioned issues with cookies, sessions, quota management, auto-posting, customer onboarding, OAuth, and more. I don’t have the specific code files you’re referring to yet, but I’ll lay out a clear plan to review and fix these components based on common pitfalls in Replit-based social media automation apps. Upload those files when you can, and I’ll zero in on the exact issues.

Launch Readiness Plan: Key Areas to Fix
Cookies and Session Management
Common Issues: Expired sessions, invalid cookies, or improper storage leading to authentication failures.
Fixes:
Ensure cookies are stored securely (e.g., encrypted in a database or secure storage, not plain text).
Implement session refresh logic using OAuth refresh tokens to maintain user sessions.
Check for proper session handling in Replit’s environment (e.g., Flask/Django session middleware or equivalent).
Verify cookie expiration policies align with platform APIs (e.g., Twitter/X, Instagram).
Launch Checklist:
Test session persistence across user logins.
Validate cookie handling for multiple platforms.
Ensure no hard-coded secrets in Replit’s environment.
Quota Management
Common Issues: Exceeding API rate limits (e.g., Twitter/X API, Instagram Graph API) or poorly tracked quotas causing app downtime.
Fixes:
Implement a quota tracking system (e.g., Redis or a database table) to monitor API calls per user/platform.
Use rate-limiting libraries (e.g., ratelimit in Python) to throttle requests.
Handle API rate limit errors gracefully (e.g., HTTP 429) with exponential backoff.
Launch Checklist:
Verify quota tracking for each connected social media account.
Test error handling for rate limit breaches.
Ensure compliance with each platform’s API usage policies.
Auto-Posting
Common Issues: Failed posts due to invalid tokens, malformed API requests, or scheduling bugs.
Fixes:
Validate OAuth tokens before each post and refresh if expired.
Use a task queue (e.g., Celery with Redis on Replit) for reliable scheduling.
Ensure post payloads match platform requirements (e.g., text length, media formats).
Log post failures with detailed errors for debugging.
Launch Checklist:
Test scheduled posts across platforms (Twitter/X, Instagram, etc.).
Confirm media uploads (images/videos) work without errors.
Verify scheduling logic handles time zones correctly.
Customer Onboarding
Common Issues: Confusing UX, failed account connections, or incomplete user data collection.
Fixes:
Streamline OAuth flow with clear redirects and error messages.
Use a frontend framework (e.g., React/Vue on Replit) for a smooth onboarding UI.
Validate user inputs (e.g., email, social media handles) before saving.
Store user data securely in a database (e.g., SQLite/PostgreSQL on Replit).
Launch Checklist:
Test full onboarding flow from sign-up to social media connection.
Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance for user data (if applicable).
Verify email confirmation or verification steps work.
OAuth
Common Issues: Token mismatches, revoked permissions, or incorrect redirect URIs.
Fixes:
Double-check OAuth client IDs, secrets, and redirect URIs in Replit’s environment variables.
Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (e.g., Authorization Code Grant) for each platform.
Store access and refresh tokens securely (e.g., encrypted in a database).
Handle token revocation gracefully with user-facing error messages.
Launch Checklist:
Test OAuth flows for all supported platforms (Twitter/X, Instagram, etc.).
Confirm token refresh works without user intervention.
Validate redirect URIs match platform developer settings.
General Replit-Specific Issues
Common Issues: Environment variable leaks, Replit runtime limitations, or dependency conflicts.
Fixes:
Use Replit’s .env file for secrets (e.g., API keys, OAuth credentials).
Optimize for Replit’s resource limits (e.g., CPU, memory) by profiling code.
Ensure dependencies in requirements.txt (or equivalent) are up-to-date and compatible.
Launch Checklist:
Run a full app test in Replit’s production-like environment.
Check for memory leaks or excessive resource usage.
Verify no sensitive data is exposed in logs or public files.
