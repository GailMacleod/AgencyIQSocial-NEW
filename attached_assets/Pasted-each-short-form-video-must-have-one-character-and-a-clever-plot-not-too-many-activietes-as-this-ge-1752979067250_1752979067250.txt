each short form video must have one character, and a clever plot, not too many activietes as this gets confusing, how can i best train you to use proper loighting, pcreative execution that drives loyalty and understand the locals

Reasoning:
To train an AI for dynamic prompt generation that consistently produces engaging, anime-influenced short-form videos for Queensland small businesses, precise guidelines and structured examples are essential. The Job To Be Done is to ensure each short video centres on a singular character, avoids overly busy scenes, and delivers a clever, memorable mini-narrative rooted in Queensland culture, all while using lighting and creative cues to evoke local pride and emotive brand loyalty. Queenslanders respond to visually compelling story moments that capture local humour, weather, and lifestyle—think golden sunlight, dramatic summer storms, playful shadows from palm trees, and the energy of after-work or weekend relaxation. The AI must recognise these cues, choose clever plots (like a barista preparing a ‘legendary’ flat white, a tradie ‘saving the day’ with wit and gusto, or a lifeguard turning a quiet beach into a magical adventure), and use lighting to amplify mood: sunrise gold for optimism, stormy purple for high-stakes, neon twilight for urban buzz. Training should involve examples of how these elements interact for emotional impact, reflect local idioms/slang, and embody a brand’s spirit in a meaningful, visually creative way. Instruct the AI to always clarify the emotional arc, specific lighting mood, and concise activity, keeping the scene focused and visually rich but clear.

Final video prompt:
Anime-inspired Queensland tradie, alone at golden hour, fixes a squeaky gate with MacGyver-like flair; as he triumphs, the backyard floods with magical sunlight and native birds swirling around him in slow-motion, celebratory BBQ smoke rises in the distance, and a knowing grin spreads on his face—visual warmth, clever solution, true local legend vibe, all captured in dreamy, sunlit hues—no text.
