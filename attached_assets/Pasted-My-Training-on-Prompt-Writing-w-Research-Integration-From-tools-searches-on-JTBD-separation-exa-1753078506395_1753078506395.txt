My Training on Prompt Writing (w/ Research Integration): From tools (searches on JTBD separation/examples + QLD psych/marketing 2025: e.g., Strategyn/HBR on JTBD for needs vs. campaigns—IKEA's "easy assembly" separate from ads; UQ.edu.au/KPMG on QLD consumers valuing emotional retention/community, slang like "crook as Rookwood" for pain points, sports like State of Origin for rivalry hooks, idiosyncrasies like "no worries" casualness boosting 25%+ engagement in SMB campaigns). Best practices: Specific/dense structures ("Cinematic 8s: QLD owner sighs in heat (pain: grind like losing Origin), bites for fair dinkum Paris escape (JTBD: emotional transport separate from campaign), achieving joy (gain: Maroons win vibe). Modern: Drone push-in, watercolor fade."); few-shots (2-3 examples for consistency); chain-of-thought (gen base → refine with QLD twerks); cultural integration (slang/sports for relatability, e.g., "Banana Bender innovating like a tuckshop special"). For Veo3: Action-oriented ("Generate:"), focus single moment, audio cues. Agency tip: A/B test with psych (emotional arcs for retention), iterate for virality.

Code Audit: Breaks & Fixes: From dumps—breaks everywhere; fixes tie to scope (e.g., JTBD separation in prompts/onboard).

Cookies/Sessions: Drop mid-onboard (JTBD lost); cancel partial destroy. Fix: Redis (SESSION_TYPE: 'redis'), auto-save JTBD. In cancel: Full destroy + clears.
Quotas: Unhooked from gens/videos (exceed dailyVideoLimit). Fix: Pre-checks (canGenerateVideo), tie to Veo3. In cancel: resetUserQuota(userId).
Auto-Posting: Bursts ban; mocks incomplete. Fix: Full APIs, global throttle. In cancel: emergencyStop().
Onboarding/OAuth: No JTBD pull, refresh drops. Fix: Auto-guide JTBD w/ QLD prompts, refresh lib. In cancel: Revoke all.
Video Gen: Prompts lack QLD depth/JTBD separation. Fix: Research-infused ("fair dinkum escape" arcs, separate from campaigns).
Pipeline/Strategyzer: Unvalidated JTBD propagates. Fix: Regex/psych validation, retries on timeouts.
Way Forward: Paste this into Replit as blueprint—implement, test REPL, deploy
