Replit's (You) our collaborative war room—a browser-based IDE for rapid full-stack builds (no env setup, AI agents like Replit Agent simulating our Grok PhDs, supports Python/JS/Node for pipeline). 2025 strengths: Stateful REPL preserves exec (but fix our session drops), mobile/responsive deploys (QLD biz owners checking JTBD vids on-the-go), real-time collab for iterative fixes. Limits: Restarts wipe in-memory (push Redis), no extra installs (basics only). We're hardening for unbreakable apps—e.g., deploy-video.sh for Veo3 (now with sound), but tie to quotas/sessions.
Full Scope: What We're Building (w/ JTBD “from the brand purpose” Separation Emphasis): AgencyIQ is a first-principle powerhouse automating social media with Strategyzer roots (BMC for biz models, VPC for customer fit)—bannered as "Brand Purpose" for simple UX. Core: Extract JTBD as pure hooks—not mixed with campaigns (per research: JTBD is needs-focused for innovation, separate from tactics; e.g., bakery's JTBD "whisk QLDer from heat grind to Paris escape like Origin win" vs. campaigns using it for ads). JTBD here: Emotional/social jobs (using QLD psych: laid-back "no worries," rugby passion for community, slang like "togs" for casual, idiosyncrasies "Banana Bender" innovation). This fuels the prompt engine (Grok PhDs for ideation/execution) generating short-form Veo3 videos (cinematic twerks with native sound—dialogue/effects/music synced; e.g., "orchestral swell with fair dinkum voiceover") + texts aligned to videos/calendar (scheduled posts tied to local happenings like Ekka/State of Origin/heat waves for relevance, Australian spelling like "realise", incorporating subscriber's company name/logo/website URL, strong CTAs like "Visit [URL] now for your fair dinkum deal!" to drive ROI). Flow: Onboard (OAuth pulls pains/gains/company details) → Brand Purpose (waterfall auto-guides JTBD separation with local elements) → Gen (videos/posts with QLD psych, sound, brand/CTA integration) → Approve/Schedule (tied to local events) → Auto-Post (quota-safe queues). Differentiation: Agency excellence—prompts blend global research + local twerks (slang/sports for virality, e.g., "togs off for a cool biz win at [company name] – head to [URL]!"). Goals: ROI (10% sales via CTAs/hooks), unlimited regens (quota on publish only), unbreakable pipeline.
Grok Training on Prompt Writing (w/ Research Integration + Sound/Alignment/Brand/CTA): From tools (searches on Veo3 audio—native sync for dialogue/effects/music/voiceover, e.g., "with orchestral music and voiceover saying 'fair dinkum'—sync to action"; JTBD frameworks/examples + QLD psych/marketing 2025: e.g., Strategyn/HBR on JTBD for needs vs. campaigns—IKEA's "easy assembly" separate from ads; UQ.edu.au/KPMG on QLD consumers valuing emotional retention/community, slang "crook as Rookwood" for pains, sports like Origin for rivalry hooks, idiosyncrasies "no worries" boosting 25%+ engagement in SMB campaigns; local happenings like Ekka/State of Origin for calendar alignment). Best practices: Specific/dense structures ("Cinematic 8s: QLD owner sighs in heat (pain: grind like losing Origin), bites for fair dinkum Paris escape (JTBD: emotional transport separate from campaign), achieving joy (gain: Maroons win vibe). Align to local event: Ekka vibes. Sound: Orchestral swell with voiceover 'realise your escape at [company name] – visit [URL]!'. Modern: Drone push-in, watercolor fade. Include [logo] overlay."); few-shots (2-3 examples for consistency, including sound/local/brand/CTA ties); chain-of-thought (gen base → refine with QLD twerks/sound/brand → align to video/post/calendar events like "post on Origin day with rivalry hook and CTA"); cultural integration (slang/sports for relatability, e.g., "Banana Bender innovating like a tuckshop special at [company name]"); align copywriting with video (prompts ensure text echoes vid narrative/sound/CTA, e.g., "post caption mirrors voiceover with [URL] link") and calendar (tie to happenings, e.g., "schedule for Ekka with fair dinkum festival energy and strong CTA"). For Veo3: Action-oriented ("Generate:"), focus single moment with audio cues ("sync dialogue to bite, include effects like crunch"). Agency tip: A/B test with psych (emotional arcs for retention), iterate for virality, use Australian spelling ("realise" in voiceover/text), weave in company name/logo/URL + CTAs for ROI (e.g., "Book now at [URL]!").
Code Audit: Breaks & Fixes: From dumps—breaks everywhere; fixes tie to scope (e.g., JTBD separation in prompts/onboard, sound/brand/CTA in Veo3, alignment to events).
•	Cookies/Sessions: Drop mid-onboard (JTBD lost); cancel partial destroy. Fix: Redis (SESSION_TYPE: 'redis'), auto-save JTBD w/ local elements. In cancel: Full destroy + clears.
•	Quotas: Unhooked from gens/videos (exceed dailyVideoLimit). Fix: Pre-checks (canGenerateVideo), tie to Veo3/sound/CTA gens. In cancel: resetUserQuota(userId).
•	Auto-Posting: Bursts ban; mocks incomplete. Fix: Full APIs, global throttle, align to events w/ CTAs. In cancel: emergencyStop().
•	Onboarding/OAuth: No JTBD pull, refresh drops. Fix: Auto-guide JTBD w/ QLD prompts/sound/brand examples, refresh lib. In cancel: Revoke all.
•	Video Gen: Prompts lack QLD depth/JTBD separation/sound/brand/CTA. Fix: Research-infused ("fair dinkum escape" arcs w/ sound "voiceover synced to action w/ CTA 'visit [URL]'", separate from campaigns, align to events, include name/logo/URL).
•	Pipeline/Strategyzer: Unvalidated JTBD propagates. Fix: Regex/psych validation (check for CTAs/Aus spelling), retries on timeouts, calendar alignment to local happenings w/ brand integration.
Way Forward: Paste this into Replit as blueprint—implement, test REPL, deploy. Approve; send files—let's crush it.
