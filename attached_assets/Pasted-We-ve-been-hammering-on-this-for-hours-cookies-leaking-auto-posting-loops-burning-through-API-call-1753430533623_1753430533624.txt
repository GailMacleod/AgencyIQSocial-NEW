We've been hammering on this for hours: cookies leaking, auto-posting loops burning through API calls, customer onboarding flows that don't gatekeep usage, and now costs spiraling because Veo 3 ain't free. You haven't dropped the latest files yet, but based on our context—video gen triggers in the backend, quota checks we sketched, OAuth for Google auth—I'll outline how to lock down costs right in the code. Send the zipped project (Python flask setup? Node? Whatever we're on), and I'll tear it apart for breaks: spot where sessions aren't tracking per-user spends, fix OAuth token refreshes to avoid retry costs, and plug quota managers to cap video gens before they bankrupt us.

First, context refresh: Veo 3's your video beast from Google—text-to-8s clips, async API calls via Gemini/Vertex AI. But costs? It's $0.75 per second of output (video + audio), pay-as-you-go in the API.developers.googleblog.com No flat fee for devs like us; it's metered, so every botched prompt or auto-post queue eats dollars. Consumer side (Gemini app) needs a $250/month AI Ultra plan for access, with credits (e.g., 10 free vids then wait), but for our app's scale—automating posts for customers—we're on API, tied to a Google Cloud billing project.datacamp.comdevelopers.googleblog.com Trials exist: Free Gemini Pro tier for starters, Cloud credits, promo codes for months free—hunt those to bootstrap.reddit.com But real management? Bake it into code, or watch onboarding tank when new users blast $100 in test gens.

Here's the fix plan—I'll pseudo-code it for our Replit setup (assuming Flask/Python with Replit DB for sessions, OAuthlib for Google auth). This ties into everything: Cookies for user sessions track spends, quotas enforce caps, auto-posting throttles, onboarding warns on costs.

Billing Setup & Monitoring (Pre-Code): Link your Google Cloud project with billing enabled—API won't fire without it.developers.googleblog.com Set budget alerts in Google Cloud Console: Email at 50%/90% thresholds to kill runaway spends. No quotas specified for Veo 3 yet, but assume rate limits (e.g., requests/min)—query via SDK.

Usage Tracking in Sessions/Cookies: Our sessions are broken if they're not persisting user data—fix with Replit DB tied to cookies. Track cumulative seconds generated per user/session. On login (OAuth flow), load/init their usage dict.

Pseudo-code snippet (add to your auth.py or main app):

Copy
from replit import db
import secrets  # For cookie secrets if not using Flask sessions

# In OAuth callback, after token grab
def handle_oauth_callback(user_id):
    session['user_id'] = user_id  # Cookie-backed
    if user_id not in db:
        db[user_id] = {'video_seconds': 0, 'monthly_spend_est': 0}
    return redirect('/dashboard')

# Before any Veo call, check/update
def check_usage(user_id, requested_seconds=8):  # Default Veo clip
    user_data = db[user_id]
    if user_data['video_seconds'] + requested_seconds > 100:  # Your cap, e.g., $60/month est
        raise Exception("Quota exceeded - upgrade or wait")
    # Proceed to gen, then post-gen:
    user_data['video_seconds'] += actual_seconds  # From API response
    user_data['monthly_spend_est'] += actual_seconds * 0.75
    db[user_id] = user_data
Broken spot: If sessions expire mid-gen (OAuth token timeout), retries double costs—refresh tokens proactively in a middleware.

Quota Management & Cost Estimation: Wrap Veo API calls (via google-generativeai SDK) with pre-checks. Estimate: $0.75 * seconds. For auto-posting scripts (your cron-like loop pulling queues), add throttling—e.g., max 5 gens/hour per customer.

In video_gen.py:

Copy
import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key=REPLIT_SECRET['GOOGLE_API_KEY'])

def generate_video(prompt, user_id):
    check_usage(user_id)  # From above
    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-pro')  # Or Veo-specific
    response = model.generate_content([prompt], generation_config={'mime_type': 'video/mp4'})
    # Poll for done, get seconds from metadata
    actual_seconds = response.video_metadata.duration_seconds  # Assuming API returns this
    # Update usage post-success
    return response.video_url
Onboarding fix: In signup flow, show "Est cost: $6 per video—confirm?" popup. Tie to cookies for persistent consent.

Auto-Posting Optimizations: Your loops are killing us— if they're triggering Veo on every post queue without filters, costs explode. Add: Skip gen if stock video exists, use shorter clips (Veo min? Aim 4s), or fallback to cheaper models (Veo 3 Fast incoming, lower $/sec).developers.googleblog.com In posting script: Rate-limit with time.sleep(60) or scheduler.

Error Handling to Avoid Waste: Catch fails early—bad prompts cost if they queue. Validate inputs, handle API errors without retry loops. Log everything to Replit console for audits.

Free/Cheap Hacks: Start with trials—Gemini Pro free for basics, then Cloud $300 credits.reddit.com For prod, bill customers: Onboard with Stripe integration, charge per gen to cover.

This should plug the leaks—costs managed, no backend zombies.
