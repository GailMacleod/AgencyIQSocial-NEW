Generate videos with Veo 3

Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art model for generating high-fidelity, 8-second 720p videos from a text prompt, featuring stunning realism and natively generated audio. Veo 3 excels at a wide range of visual and cinematic styles. Choose an example below to see how to generate a video with dialogue, cinematic realism, or creative animation.

Dialogue & Sound Effects Cinematic Realism Creative Animation

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

import time
from google import genai

client = genai.Client()
prompt = "A whimsical stop-motion animation of a tiny robot tending to a garden of glowing mushrooms on a miniature planet."

operation = client.models.generate_videos(
    model="veo-3.0-generate-preview",
    prompt=prompt,
)

# Poll the operation status until the video is ready
while not operation.done:
    print("Waiting for video generation to complete...")
    time.sleep(10)
    operation = client.operations.get(operation)

# Download the generated video
generated_video = operation.response.generated_videos[0]
client.files.download(file=generated_video.video)
generated_video.video.save("style_example.mp4")
print("Generated video saved to style_example.mp4")


Generating videos from images
The following code demonstrates generating an image using Imagen, then using that image as the starting frame for the video.

Note: Veo 3 image to video is coming soon! You can use Veo 2 (no audio) until then.
Python
JavaScript
Go

import time
from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

prompt = "Panning wide shot of a calico kitten sleeping in the sunshine"

# Step 1: Generate an image with Imagen
imagen = client.models.generate_images(
    model="imagen-3.0-generate-002",
    prompt=prompt,
)

# Step 2: Generate video with Veo 2 using the image
operation = client.models.generate_videos(
    model="veo-2.0-generate-001",
    prompt=prompt,
    image=imagen.generated_images[0].image,
)

# Poll the operation status until the video is ready
while not operation.done:
    print("Waiting for video generation to complete...")
    time.sleep(10)
    operation = client.operations.get(operation)

# Download the video
video = operation.response.generated_videos[0]
client.files.download(file=video.video)
video.video.save("veo2_with_image_input.mp4")
print("Generated video saved to veo2_with_image_input.mp4")
Video generation parameters and specifications
These are the parameters you can set in your API request to control the video generation process.

Parameter	Description	Veo 3 (Preview)	Veo 2 (Stable)
prompt	The text description for the video. Supports audio cues.	string	string
negativePrompt	Text describing what to avoid in the video.	string	string
image	An initial image to animate.	Not Supported	Image object
aspectRatio	The video's aspect ratio.	"16:9"	"16:9", "9:16"
personGeneration	Controls the generation of people.	"allow_all"	"allow_all", "allow_adult", "dont_allow"
You can customize your video generation by setting parameters in your request. For example you can specify negativePrompt to guide the model.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

import time
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

operation = client.models.generate_videos(
    model="veo-3.0-generate-preview",
    prompt="A cinematic shot of a majestic lion in the savannah.",
    config=types.GenerateVideosConfig(negative_prompt="cartoon, drawing, low quality"),
)

# Poll the operation status until the video is ready
while not operation.done:
    print("Waiting for video generation to complete...")
    time.sleep(10)
    operation = client.operations.get(operation)

# Download the generated video
generated_video = operation.response.generated_videos[0]
client.files.download(file=generated_video.video)
generated_video.video.save("parameters_example.mp4")
print("Generated video saved to parameters_example.mp4")
Handling Asynchronous Operations
Video generation is a computationally intensive task. When you send a request, the API starts a long-running job and immediately returns an operation object. You must then poll until the video is ready, which is indicated by the done status being true.

The core of this process is a polling loop, which periodically checks the job's status.

Python
JavaScript

import time
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

# After starting the job, you get an operation object
operation = client.models.generate_videos(
    model="veo-3.0-generate-preview",
    prompt="A cinematic shot of a majestic lion in the savannah.",
)

# Alternatively, you can use the operation.name to get the operation
operation = types.GenerateVideosOperation(name=operation.name)

# This loop checks the job status every 10 seconds
while not operation.done:
    time.sleep(10)
    # Refresh the operation object to get the latest status
    operation = client.operations.get(operation)

# Once done, the result is in operation.response
# ... process and download your video ...

Veo prompt guide
This section contains examples of videos you can create using Veo, and shows you how to modify prompts to produce distinct results.

Safety filters
Veo applies safety filters across Gemini to help ensure that generated videos and uploaded photos don't contain offensive content. Prompts that violate our terms and guidelines are blocked.

Prompting for Audio (Veo 3)
With Veo 3, you can provide cues for sound effects, ambient noise, and dialogue. The model captures the nuance of these cues to generate a synchronized soundtrack.

Dialogue: Use quotes for specific speech. (Example: "This must be the key," he murmured.)
Sound Effects (SFX): Explicitly describe sounds. (Example: tires screeching loudly, engine roaring.)
Ambient Noise: Describe the environment's soundscape. (Example: A faint, eerie hum resonates in the background.)
These videos demonstrate prompting Veo 3's audio generation with increasing levels of detail.

Prompt writing basics
Good prompts are descriptive and clear. To get the most out of Veo, start with identifying your core idea, refine your idea by adding keywords and modifiers, and incorporate video-specific terminology into your prompts.

The following elements should be included in your prompt:

Subject: The object, person, animal, or scenery that you want in your video, such as cityscape, nature, vehicles, or puppies.
Action: What the subject is doing (for example, walking, running, or turning their head).
Style: Specify creative direction using specific film style keywords, such as sci-fi, horror film, film noir, or animated styles like cartoon.
Camera positioning and motion: [Optional] Control the camera's location and movement using terms like aerial view, eye-level, top-down shot, dolly shot, or worms eye.
Composition: [Optional] How the shot is framed, such as wide shot, close-up, single-shot or two-shot.
Focus and lens effects: [Optional] Use terms like shallow focus, deep focus, soft focus, macro lens, and wide-angle lens to achieve specific visual effects.
Ambiance: [Optional] How the color and light contribute to the scene, such as blue tones, night, or warm tones.
More tips for writing prompts
Use descriptive language: Use adjectives and adverbs to paint a clear picture for Veo.
Enhance the facial details: Specify facial details as a focus of the photo like using the word portrait in the prompt.

Man on the phone
These videos demonstrate how you can revise your prompt with increasingly specific details to get Veo to refine the output to your liking.

Prompt	Generated output
Less detail
The camera dollies to show a close up of a desperate man in a green trench coat. He's making a call on a rotary-style wall phone with a green neon light. It looks like a movie scene.	Man talking on the phone.
More detail
A close-up cinematic shot follows a desperate man in a weathered green trench coat as he dials a rotary phone mounted on a gritty brick wall, bathed in the eerie glow of a green neon sign. The camera dollies in, revealing the tension in his jaw and the desperation etched on his face as he struggles to make the call. The shallow depth of field focuses on his furrowed brow and the black rotary phone, blurring the background into a sea of neon colors and indistinct shadows, creating a sense of urgency and isolation.	Man talking on the phone
Snow leopard
Prompt	Generated output
Simple prompt:
A cute creature with snow leopard-like fur is walking in winter forest, 3D cartoon style render.	Snow leopard is lethargic.
Detailed prompt:
Create a short 3D animated scene in a joyful cartoon style. A cute creature with snow leopard-like fur, large expressive eyes, and a friendly, rounded form happily prances through a whimsical winter forest.
