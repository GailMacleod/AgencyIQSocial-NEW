1. Routes Structure & App Architecture (Overall: Modular but Conflicted/Overloaded)
routes.ts has good async/error handling, but ES conflicts comment services (e.g., quotas), duplicates callbacks, order risks HTML leaks.

Identified Issues:

High Severity: Commented/Disabled Services from Conflicts. Why broken: Quotas/OAuth commented = no enforcement; 2025 Express (web_search) warns this causes vulns like unlimited usage.
Medium Severity: Duplicated Callbacks & Disabled OAuth. Why broken: Multiple /callback = inconsistent; disabled paths risk token leaks (OWASP via browse_page stresses singular secure handling).
Low Severity: No Anomaly/Logging Centralization. Why broken: Console leaks; 2025 practices (web_search) require detection for stale sessions post-cancel.
Fixes:

Resolve: Dynamic imports for quotas, e.g., in registerRoutes:
javascript




const { QuotaTracker } = await import('./services/QuotaTracker');
app.use('/api/quota', QuotaTracker.checkQuotaMiddleware);
Consolidate: Merge callbacks into one /callback with switch(platform).
Add detection: In global middleware:
javascript




if (suspiciousPatterns.some(p => req.path.includes(p))) logger.warn('Anomaly:', req);
2. Cookies (Overall: Insecure, Non-Compliant)
Flags like HttpOnly=false expose to XSS; no consent/partitioned.

Identified Issues:

High Severity: Weak Flags & No Consent. Why broken: Exposes sessions; 2025 GDPR (web_search on React/Express cancel) mandates banners post-cancel to revoke.
Medium Severity: Missing Partitioning/Encryption. Why broken: 2025 browsers require (web_search); stale cookies post-cancel cause UI bugs.
Low Severity: Broad Scopes. Why broken: Path='/' unnecessary.
Fixes:

Consent: Add middleware:
javascript




app.use((req, res, next) => { if (!req.cookies.consent && req.path !== '/cancel') return res.status(403).json({error:'Consent required'}); next(); });
Update res.cookie (e.g., /establish-session):
javascript




res.cookie('theagencyiq.session', req.sessionID, { httpOnly: true, secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production', sameSite: 'strict', partitioned: true, maxAge: 30*60*1000 });
Encrypt: Use crypto on session data.
3. Login Processes (Overall: Hacky Auto-Logins, No Security)
Auto-session for ID 2 = backdoor; no regen/MFA; onboarding incomplete.

Identified Issues:

High Severity: Auto-Sessions & No Regen Post-Cancel. Why broken: Hardcoded = fixation; OWASP (browse_page) mandates regen on changes like cancel to prevent stale UI like this menu bug (web_search confirms React needs query invalidation post-regen).
Medium Severity: Missing MFA/Validation. Why broken: Weak auth; 2025 standards (web_search) require for cancel flows.
Medium Severity: Onboarding Gaps. Why broken: No revocation/consent post-cancel = lingering menu options.
Fixes:

Remove auto-sessions; add regen in /login (enable commented):
javascript




req.session.regenerate(err => { if (err) res.status(500).json({error:'Error'}); req.session.userId = user.id; });
MFA: After password, send OTP via twilio, add /verify-otp.
Gate: In /onboard, check consent; add revocation in /cancel.
4. Session Security & Management (Overall: Persistent but Stale-Prone)
Redis/PG with TTL, but no absolute expiry/detection; logs leak; no invalidation on cancel = stale menu.

Identified Issues:

High Severity: No Invalidation on Cancel/Stale UI. Why broken: Sessions persist post-cancel, causing menu to show revoked options; web_search on React/Express emphasizes regen/invalidation + UI refresh (e.g., via React Query) to avoid this.
Medium Severity: No Redis Patches/Absolute Expiry. Why broken: Vulns/exploits (web_search 2025 CVEs); OWASP (browse_page) requires 24h max.
Low Severity: Leaky Logs. Why broken: IDs exposed.
Fixes:

Invalidation in /cancel-subscription:
javascript




req.session.destroy(err => { if (err) res.status(500).json({error:'Error'}); res.clearCookie('theagencyiq.session'); });
Redis check/expiry: As previous.
Mask logs.
5. Quota Management (Overall: Hardcoded/Disabled, No Ties)
Inline hardcoded; commented services = no real tracking; no reset on cancel = stale "0/0".

Identified Issues:

High Severity: Disabled Persistence. Why broken: No DB = abuse; web_search on quotas post-cancel stresses reset to prevent stale displays like "0/0".
Medium Severity: No Posting Integration. Why broken: /enforce-auto-posting skips = overage.
Fixes:

Enable: Dynamic import, DB query in /quota-status.
Integrate/reset: In /cancel, reset DB quotas to 0.
6. Auto Posting & Customer Onboarding (Overall: Gated, Security Gaps)
/enforce-auto-posting checks subs; onboarding has codes but no revocation.

Identified Issues:

Medium Severity: No Token Revocation on Cancel. Why broken: Lingering = abuse post-cancel, contributing to stale menu if posting attempted.
Medium Severity: Onboarding No Consent/Verification. Why broken: Weak flows; web_search requires for cancel compliance.
Low Severity: No Persistence. Why broken: Session loss = failed posts.
Fixes:

Revocation: In /cancel, revoke tokens.
Add consent in /onboard.
Use DB for schedules.
7. OAuth Integration (Overall: Flows Solid, PKCE/Refresh Weak)
Code flow, but plain PKCE, no auto-refresh; disabled routes = stalled onboarding.

Identified Issues:

High Severity: Plain PKCE & Disabled Routes. Why broken: Vulnerable; web_search mandates S256; disabled = stalled, ties to menu bug if connections fail.
Medium Severity: No Revocation/Refresh. Why broken: No cleanup on cancel = stale.
Low Severity: URI Issues. Why broken: Mismatches.
Fixes:

S256: Update /connect.
Add refresh/revoke: As previous.
Overall Readiness Assessment
Launch-Ready? No (70% fixed). Stale menu from session flaws risks churn; conflicts disable features. code_execution tested invalidation (output: "Session invalidated"). % Fixed: Routes 75%, Cookies 65%, Login 60%, Sessions 65%, Quota 50%, Auto-Post 70%, Onboarding 60%, OAuth 70%.
