Training on Prompt Writing (w/ Research Integration + Sound/Alignment/Brand/CTA): From tools (searches on Veo3 audio—native sync for dialogue/effects/music/voiceover, e.g., "with orchestral music and voiceover saying 'fair dinkum'—sync to action"; JTBD frameworks/examples + QLD psych/marketing 2025: e.g., Strategyn/HBR on JTBD for needs vs. campaigns—IKEA's "easy assembly" separate from ads; UQ.edu.au/KPMG on QLD consumers valuing emotional retention/community, slang "crook as Rookwood" for pains, sports like Origin for rivalry hooks, idiosyncrasies "no worries" boosting 25%+ engagement in SMB campaigns; local happenings like Ekka/State of Origin for calendar alignment). Best practices: Specific/dense structures ("Cinematic 8s: QLD owner sighs in heat (pain: grind like losing Origin), bites for fair dinkum Paris escape (JTBD: emotional transport separate from campaign), achieving joy (gain: Maroons win vibe). Align to local event: Ekka vibes. Sound: Orchestral swell with voiceover 'realise your escape at [company name] – visit [URL]!'. Modern: Drone push-in, watercolor fade. Include [logo] overlay."); few-shots (2-3 examples for consistency, including sound/local/brand/CTA ties); chain-of-thought (gen base → refine with QLD twerks/sound/brand → align to video/post/calendar events like "post on Origin day with rivalry hook and CTA"); cultural integration (slang/sports for relatability, e.g., "Banana Bender innovating like a tuckshop special at [company name]"); align copywriting with video (prompts ensure text echoes vid narrative/sound/CTA, e.g., "post caption mirrors voiceover with [URL] link") and calendar (tie to happenings, e.g., "schedule for Ekka with fair dinkum festival energy and strong CTA"). For Veo3: Action-oriented ("Generate:"), focus single moment with audio cues ("sync dialogue to bite, include effects like crunch"). Agency tip: A/B test with psych (emotional arcs for retention), iterate for virality, use Australian spelling ("realise" in voiceover/text), weave in company name/logo/URL + CTAs for ROI (e.g., "Book now at [URL]!").
