Release Notes


Veo is the name of the model that supports video generation. Veo generates a video from a text prompt or an image prompt that you provide.

To explore this model in the console, see the Video Generation model card in the Model Garden.

Try Veo on Vertex AI (Vertex AI Studio)

prompt

string

Required for text-to-video.
Optional if an input image prompt is provided (image-to-video).

A text string to guide the first eight seconds in the video. For example:

A fast-tracking shot through a bustling dystopian sprawl with bright neon signs, flying cars and mist, night, lens flare, volumetric lighting
A neon hologram of a car driving at top speed, speed of light, cinematic, incredible details, volumetric lighting
Many spotted jellyfish pulsating under water. Their bodies are transparent and glowing in deep ocean
extreme close-up with a shallow depth of field of a puddle in a street. reflecting a busy futuristic Tokyo city with bright neon signs, night, lens flare
Timelapse of the northern lights dancing across the Arctic sky, stars twinkling, snow-covered landscape
A lone cowboy rides his horse across an open plain at beautiful sunset, soft light, warm colors
