Data Cleanup





Archive pre-quota system posts (106 excess for User ID 2) to a separate posts_archive table.



Retain only current cycle posts (23 published, within 52-post quota).



Reset user quota to reflect accurate state: 52 total, 29 remaining (52 - 23 published).



Quota Reconciliation





Validate published post count (23) via SQL query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE user_id = 2 AND status = 'published';.



Update remaining_posts to 29 in users table for User ID 2.



Reflect accurate quota (29/52) in frontend UI for transparency.



Historical Data Audit





Query all users with total_posts > 52 to identify quota exceedances: SELECT id, email, total_posts FROM users WHERE total_posts > 52;.



Log legacy post sources (e.g., pre-July 2025 testing) in a legacy_data_log table.



Define cleanup SOP: archive excess posts, update quotas, notify users.



Gift Certificate Cleanup





Archive redeemed certificates (e.g., PROF-TEST-IBLGLY2F) to gift_certificates_archive table, retaining original certificate numbers and metadata (code, plan, redeemed date).



Ensure active certificates remain in gift_certificates table with unchanged codes.



Verify no duplicate certificate numbers via: SELECT code, COUNT(*) FROM gift_certificates GROUP BY code HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;.

8.2 System Improvements





Enhanced Monitoring





Implement real-time quota dashboard tracking remaining_posts and total_posts per user.



Set anomaly alerts for total_posts > 52 or unexpected post status changes.



Log historical quota trends in quota_history table for audit trails.



Data Cleanup Automation





Schedule monthly cron job to archive posts older than 6 months or exceeding quotas.



Enforce retention policy: keep only active cycle posts; archive others to posts_archive.



Auto-remove orphaned data (e.g., posts without valid user_id) via: DELETE FROM posts WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM users);.



User Communication





Display quota status (e.g., "29/52 posts remaining") on all frontend pages.



Notify users of legacy post cleanup with email explaining historical data and new quota.



Announce system updates (e.g., cleanup automation) via in-app banners and email.



Gift Certificate Management





Add UI warning during redemption if phone number matches existing user to prevent account linkage.



Log certificate lifecycle (generated, redeemed, archived) in certificate_audit_log table.



Allow admin to query certificate status by code without altering original numbers.
