Based on history and the update, the best approach is to abandon Vite, standardize on esbuild, clean the client entry, and align static serving. Here’s why and how:

Fix Development Server: Vite’s import syntax issues (e.g., module not found errors) stemmed from Replit incompatibilities. Switching to esbuild resolves this, as it’s proven stable and faster, supporting the 693K bundle and video workflows.
Standardize Build Process: Using both Vite and esbuild created confusion (e.g., mixed configs, deployment failures). Esbuild’s simplicity and Replit compatibility make it the clear choice, aligning with our successful video integration.
Clean Up Client Entry: Removing JavaScript imports from client/src/main.tsx ensures TypeScript consistency, eliminating type errors and simplifying maintenance.
Consolidate Static Serving: Aligning development and production paths fixes CSP mismatches (e.g., video load blocks) and 404s, ensuring reliability across environments.
Advised Actions
Fix Development Server:
Remove all Vite-related files (e.g., vite.config.ts) and dependencies.
Use esbuild with a development script (e.g., npx esbuild --watch client/src/main.tsx --bundle --outfile=dist/main.js --format=iife --loader:.js=jsx --minify) to enable hot reloading and resolve boot failures.
Standardize Build Process:
Adopt esbuild exclusively. Update build.sh to:
bash




npx esbuild client/src/main.tsx --bundle --outfile=dist/main.js --format=iife --loader:.js=jsx --minify
cp client/index.html dist/index.html
Verify the bundle stays <1MB and test deployment on Replit.
Clean Up Client Entry:
Open client/src/main.tsx and remove any JavaScript imports (e.g., .js files). Ensure all dependencies are TypeScript-compatible (e.g., .tsx or .ts).
Rebuild and confirm no type errors in the console.
Consolidate Static Serving:
Update server/index.ts to serve static files consistently:
typescript




const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.static('dist', { maxAge: '1d' }));
app.use(express.static('public'));
app.get('*', (req, res) => res.sendFile('dist/index.html', { root: __dirname }));
app.listen(5000, () => console.log('Server on 5000'));
Adjust the CSP in the same file (e.g., via helmet) to:
text



default-src 'self' https://4fc77172-459a-4da7-8c33-5014abb1b73e-00-dqhtnud4ismj.worf.replit.dev https://*.facebook.com https://*.fbcdn.net https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net;
media-src 'self' https://seedance-api.github.io https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com;
Test video loading (e.g., BigBuckBunny.mp4) to confirm alignment.
Preserve Stability:
No changes to backend (Express, port 5000), OAuth, or Seedance content generation.
Keep bundle <1MB, memory <256MB.
Test Incrementally:
Validate the development server boots with esbuild.
Check the client entry builds cleanly.
Verify static files load in both dev and production.
Ensure video workflows (once added) work with the new setup.
