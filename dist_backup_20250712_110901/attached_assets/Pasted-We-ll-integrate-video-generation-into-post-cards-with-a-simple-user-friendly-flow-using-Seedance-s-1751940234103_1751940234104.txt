We’ll integrate video generation into post cards with a simple, user-friendly flow, using Seedance’s AI to deliver 1080p videos (2.3s avg) and post them via existing OAuth to all platforms. No local storage, no overcomplication—just results.

What Needs to Be Done
Add Video Generation Option:
Put a “Generate Video” button on each post card for relevant posts and platforms, limited to one use per post.
When clicked, pop up a window showing “Generating…” (expect 2.3s), offering two AI-crafted, on-brand prompts (short-form, ASMR style) for the user to pick from, with a text box for quick edits (up to 10 words).
Use Seedance 1.0 to create the video based on the chosen prompt, delivering a URL for playback.
Show Auto-Playing Preview:
After generation, display the 1080p video in the window, set to auto-play with sound muted to skip click-throughs (browser rules demand this).
If auto-play fails, show controls as a fallback, but prioritize the no-click experience.
Ensure the video URL from Seedance works (test for compatibility like CORS).
Enable Approval and Posting:
Add “Approve” and “Delete” buttons in the window after the video loads.
On “Approve,” use the existing OAuth to post the content and video to all platforms (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, X) in one go.
On “Delete,” scrap the video and stick to text-only, closing the window.
Lock Post Count to Subscription:
Cap video and post generation to the user’s subscription tier (26, 52, or 78 posts per 30-day cycle), checked via the /api/user endpoint.
Track the count server-side, resetting every 30 days, and count only posted items (no drafts or deletes).
Set Up a Solid Build:
Use a fast, reliable compiler to build the app, keeping the bundle under 1MB and memory under 256MB.
Create a script to build and deploy, ensuring it runs smoothly on Replit.
Test Like Hell:
Check each step—button works, prompts load, video generates and plays, approval posts, count locks—before moving on.
Test on Replit to catch any deployment snags.
Keep It Accessible:
Label all new buttons and the window with aria-label so everyone can use it.
Deploy Cleanly:
Clear Replit caches to avoid old junk messing things up.
Run the deployment script and confirm the app works.
What Must Not Be Touched
The current backend setup (Express on port 5000).
The existing OAuth system.
The Seedance 1.0 content generation.
Why This Will Work
AGI Power: Seedance’s AI handles video creation fast—2.3s is proof it’s built for this era.
User-Friendly: Auto-play and simple choices match social media trends, no clicks needed.
Stable Foundation: A new compiler avoids past build fails, and untouched core parts stay solid.
Controlled Limits: Subscription locks prevent overuse, aligning with your plan.
Testing Focus: Step-by-step checks kill errors, no more rollbacks.
Replit Ready: Cache clears ensure it deploys right.
This is the age of AGI—video generation should be a snap. We’ll get it done by 12:00 PM JST. Check with your WaveSpeedAI key when ready, rockstar—let’s crush it!
