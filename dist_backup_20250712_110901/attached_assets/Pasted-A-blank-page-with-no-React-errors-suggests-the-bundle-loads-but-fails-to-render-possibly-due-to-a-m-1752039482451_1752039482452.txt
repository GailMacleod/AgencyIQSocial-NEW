A blank page with no React errors suggests the bundle loads but fails to render, possibly due to a missing root element, mounting issue, or JavaScript execution halt.
The successful July 9th build (earlier today) worked, so the regression likely occurred post-deployment or after a configuration change.
Replit’s iframe warnings might hint at a rendering environment issue, but the core problem is likely client-side.
Past build switches (Vite to esbuild) and client cleanup could have introduced subtle breaks.
Constraints: Preserve backend, OAuth, Seedance content; no local storage; bundle <1MB, memory <256MB.
Step-by-Step Reverse Engineering
Last Working State (July 9th, Earlier Today):
build-replit.js or esbuild produced a working dist/main.js and dist/index.html.
server/index.ts served /static/main.js with a CSP allowing video sources.
main.tsx mounted React to <div id="root"> with createRoot.
Preview loaded in List view.
Current State:
Bundle builds, server runs (port 5000), but the preview is blank.
No new React errors, but iframe warnings and PWA issues appear.
manifest.json 503 from earlier might persist, affecting Replit’s preview.
Possible Causes:
Mounting Failure: The root element or createRoot call might be missing or mismatched.
Script Loading: /static/main.js might not execute due to a timing issue or 404.
Iframe Interference: Replit’s sandbox or unrecognized features might disrupt rendering.
Manifest 503: A service unavailable error could prevent Replit from initializing the preview.
What’s Going On
The absence of a React error suggests main.tsx imports React correctly, but the app isn’t rendering. This points to:
Mounting Issue: The DOM element (#root) might be missing, or createRoot isn’t firing.
Script Execution: dist/index.html might not load /static/main.js, or the script fails silently.
Replit Preview Bug: The 503 on manifest.json and iframe warnings could indicate Replit’s preview engine isn’t processing the app, even if the server runs.
The July 9th working state relied on a specific dist structure and serving logic, which might have shifted.
